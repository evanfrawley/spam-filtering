This repository contains the files for Problem Set 4, for the INFO 371 Data Science II: Machine Learning and Econometrics at the University of Washington.

The goal of this assignment was to piece together a report about at least 2 different machine learning models and analyze their tradeoffs. The paper for this assignment can be found under [`SpamFiltering.pdf`](https://github.com/evanfrawley/spam-filtering/blob/master/SpamFiltering.pdf) and was compiled from `SpamFiltering.md` using the Atom extension `md2csv`.

Our machine learning methods can be found under [`Predictions.ipynb`](https://github.com/evanfrawley/spam-filtering/blob/master/Predictions.ipynb).

You can run the code on your own machine against your own emails by downloading your Gmail data [here](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout). Specifically, you will need the `Inbox` and `Spam` labels.

Please feel free to reach out to either of us if you have questions!
Cheers!

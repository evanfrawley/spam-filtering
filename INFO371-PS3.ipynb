    "Make sure the following libraries load correctly (hit Ctrl-Enter). Note that while you are loading several powerful libraries, including machine learning libraries, the goal of this problem set is to implement several algorithms from scratch. In particular, you should *not* be using any built-in libraries for nearest neighbors, distance metrics, or cross-validation -- your mission is to write those algorithms in Python! Parts 1 and 2 will be relatively easy; Part 3 will take more time.\n",

    "*Also note:* For this assignment we are requiring you to use base **matplotlib** - no more Seaborn or other packages. This will help you become familiar with techniques for maintaining fine-grained control over your data visualizations. It will also help our graders, who spent countless hours trying to make various versions import for grading."
